## Introduction

This project is a blockchain exchange for individuals. Individuals are able to connect their metamask wallets to the blockchain, send ethereum to any address anywhere in the world, add a message accompanied by a gif, view recent transactions and verify the transaction through the ropsten blockchain network.

As a part of the Blockchain revolution, it serves as a practice for me to learn lessons on how to use the blockchain technologies, Solidity language and build robust payment solutions for the future.

By completing this project, I have learned and applied my skills at structuring and implementing well formatted blockchain application, connected it to a React frontend and leverage knowledge of Solidity, HardHat and Ropsten network best practices.
